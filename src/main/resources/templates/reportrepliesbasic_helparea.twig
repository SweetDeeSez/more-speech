		This page shows how Twitter rearranges replies, hiding some of them.
		</p>

		<p>
		Each table below shows a tweet that @{{ initiating_user }} has replied to, the @{{ initiating_user }}
		tweet reply, and statistics from the reply page:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>The "Status" column summarizes where the reply tweet ranked on the reply page. In some
			cases, the reply tweet will be hidden (see the note below).</li>
			<li>The "Rank" column is the order of the reply tweet on the reply page.</li>
			<li>The "Expected Rank By Interaction" column is the expected rank of the reply tweet
			based on how many replies/retweets/favorites the reply tweet has received.</li>
			<li>The "Expected Rank By Date" column is the expected rank of the reply tweet based on when the reply was made.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		Note: a hidden tweet is one that's hidden behind the "Show more replies" link at the end of the reply page.
		Few probably click that link, and the account that was replied to might not see those hidden tweets
		on their "Notifications" page depending on their settings. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Some tweets are put even lower down, into an "AbusiveQuality" section.
